All state lives in InMemoryBackend maps/store.Tables guarded by lockmetrics.RWMutex; every lock path uses defer-release."}

## Notes

Protocol: SWF is **awsjson1.0** (`application/x-amz-json-1.0`, `X-Amz-Target:
SimpleWorkflowService.<Op>`) -- confirmed against the real
`aws-sdk-go-v2/service/swf` serializers (every op sets
`Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.0`). This is easy to mis-key as
awsjson1.1 (the more common AWS JSON protocol) since SWF's dispatch shape
looks identical otherwise.

### Real bugs fixed this pass (2026-07-23)

1. **ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution never started the new run**
   (`decision_orchestration.go`, new file): the decision closed the execution
   as `CONTINUED_AS_NEW` and stopped -- no fresh `RunID`, no re-seeded
   decision task, so a decider that relied on continue-as-new saw the
   workflow simply dead-end forever. Fixed by resolving the (possibly
   re-versioned) `WorkflowType`'s defaults exactly like `StartWorkflowExecution`
   does (both now share `createExecutionLocked`), closing the old run, and
   starting a fresh one under the same `domain+workflowId` with a new `RunID`,
   `WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew` (carrying `newExecutionRunId`) followed by
   a fresh `WorkflowExecutionStarted` (carrying `continuedExecutionRunId`), and
   a decision task enqueued on the new run's task list. If the workflow type
   can't be resolved, the execution stays open and
   `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionFailed` is recorded instead (matching real
   AWS: a rejected decision never closes the run). Architectural caveat: since
   `executions`/`history` are keyed by `domain+workflowId` only (not
   `+runId`), the completed old run isn't independently queryable after
   continuation -- see gaps.
   `TestRespondDecisionTaskCompleted_ContinueAsNew`/
   `_ContinueAsNew_UnknownWorkflowType` cover both paths.

2. **StartChildWorkflowExecution/SignalExternalWorkflowExecution/
   RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution recorded an empty `*Initiated` event
   and did nothing else** (`decision_orchestration.go`): none of their
   wire-level attrs (`workflowId`, `runId`, `signalName`, `control`, etc.) were
   even parsed off the wire into the `Decision` struct, and the target
   execution was never touched. Fixed:
   - `StartChildWorkflowExecution` now actually creates the child execution
     (reusing `createExecutionLocked`), links it back to its parent
     (`WorkflowExecution.ParentWorkflowID/ParentRunID/ParentInitiatedEventID/
     ParentStartedEventID`, new fields), and records
     `ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted` on the parent. Failure (unknown/deprecated
     workflow type, or the child's workflowId already has an open run) records
     `StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed` with the matching real cause
     (`WORKFLOW_TYPE_DOES_NOT_EXIST`/`WORKFLOW_TYPE_DEPRECATED`/
     `WORKFLOW_ALREADY_RUNNING`).
   - `SignalExternalWorkflowExecution` now delivers the signal: appends
     `WorkflowExecutionSignaled` to the target's history and enqueues it a
     decision task, or `SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed`
     (`UNKNOWN_EXTERNAL_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION`) if the target isn't
     found/open/run-matching.
   - `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution` now actually requests
     cancellation: sets the target's `CancelRequested`, appends
     `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested`, and enqueues it a decision task, or
     `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed` on the same
     not-found/not-open condition.
   - A closing child (Complete/Fail/Cancel decision, or
     `TerminateWorkflowExecution`) now propagates `ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted/
     Failed/Canceled/Terminated` back onto its parent's history and gives the
     parent a fresh decision task (`propagateChildClosureLocked`), so a parent
     decider learns the outcome without polling the child directly.
   - `DescribeWorkflowExecution`/`ListOpen/ClosedWorkflowExecutions` gained the
     `executionInfo.parent` field (real AWS's `WorkflowExecutionInfo.Parent`),
     and `openCounts.openChildWorkflowExecutions` is now the real count of
     open children (previously hardcoded 0).
   All four wire-level attrs are now parsed in `handler_decision_tasks.go`
   (`convertDecisionOrchestrationAttrs`) using the exact field names confirmed
   against the real SDK's `serializers.go`
   (`continueAsNewWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes`,
   `startChildWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes`,
   `signalExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes`,
   `requestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes`).
   `decision_orchestration_test.go` covers success/failure for all three
   cross-execution decisions plus parent-closure propagation for all four
   closure paths (Complete/Fail/Cancel/Terminate);
   `TestSnapshotRestore_ChildLinkAndOpenTimers` covers the new
   `WorkflowExecution` fields surviving Snapshot/Restore.

3. **`decisionTaskCompletedEventId` was missing from every decision-derived
   history event** (`decision_tasks.go`, `decision_orchestration.go`,
   `workflow_executions.go`): field-diffed against the real SDK's
   `types.go` -- every one of `WorkflowExecutionCompleted/Failed/Canceled`,
   `ActivityTaskScheduled/CancelRequested`, `TimerStarted/Canceled`,
   `MarkerRecorded`, `WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew`, and all three new
   `*Initiated` events require this field (it's how a decider traces an event
   back to the decision that caused it), and it was absent everywhere. Fixed
   by threading `decisionTaskCompletedEventId` (captured once per
   `RespondDecisionTaskCompleted` call, from the `DecisionTaskCompleted` event
   it appends) through `decisionCtx` into every handler.

4. **StartTimer/CancelTimer never validated timerId state** (`decision_tasks.go`):
   `StartTimer` always recorded `TimerStarted` even for an already-open
   `timerId`, and `CancelTimer` always recorded `TimerCanceled` even for a
   `timerId` that was never started -- real AWS rejects both with
   `StartTimerFailed(TIMER_ID_ALREADY_IN_USE)` /
   `CancelTimerFailed(TIMER_ID_UNKNOWN)` (confirmed against the real SDK's
   `StartTimerFailedCause`/`CancelTimerFailedCause` enums). Fixed by adding
   `WorkflowExecution.OpenTimerIDs` (a per-execution open-timer set, mutated
   only by these two decisions -- there is still no autonomous timer-firing
   goroutine, consistent with this service's no-goroutine design) and
   validating against it. This also makes `openCounts.openTimers` real instead
   of hardcoded 0. `TestStartTimerDecision_AlreadyInUse`/
   `TestCancelTimerDecision_UnknownID` cover both faults.

5. **DeprecateDomain didn't cascade to the domain's registered types**
   (`domains.go`): the real SDK's doc comment on `DeprecateDomain` is explicit:
   *"Deprecating a domain also deprecates all activity and workflow types
   registered in the domain. Executions that were started before the domain
   was deprecated continue to run."* -- the emulator only flipped the domain's
   own status, leaving every workflow/activity type `REGISTERED`. Fixed to
   cascade `DEPRECATED` onto every `REGISTERED` type in the domain (already-
   deprecated types are left alone; open executions are deliberately
   untouched, matching the doc comment).
   `TestDeprecateDomain_CascadesToRegisteredTypes` covers it. (`UndeprecateDomain`
   does *not* cascade back -- the real doc comment for it makes no such claim,
   so this is intentionally one-directional.)

6. **`processDecisionLocked`'s `cyclop,funlen` nolint** (`decision_tasks.go`):
   the historical 12-decision-type `switch` carried a
   `//nolint:cyclop,funlen // 12 SWF decision types; cannot reduce without
   artificial splitting` comment. Decomposed into a `DecisionType -> handler`
   dispatch table (`decisionHandlers()`, a `sync.OnceValue`-backed
   package-level map, mirroring `services/apigatewayv2`'s `onceOpTable`
   pattern) with one small function per decision type in `decision_tasks.go`
   (simple decisions) and `decision_orchestration.go` (the four
   cross-execution ones) -- no nolint suppression needed.
   `TestDecisionHandlers_CoverAllDecisionTypes` is a table-driven test over
   the dispatch table asserting every decision type has a handler.

### Traps for the next auditor

- `RegisterDomain`/`RegisterWorkflowType`/`RegisterActivityType`'s "type
  already active" error on Undeprecate is correctly `TypeAlreadyExistsFault`
  / `DomainAlreadyExistsFault` (verified against the real deserializer
  switches for `UndeprecateDomain`/`UndeprecateWorkflowType`/
  `UndeprecateActivityType`) -- do NOT "fix" this to
  `TypeNotDeprecatedFault`/`DomainNotDeprecatedFault`; those fault types
  don't even exist for these ops (only for `Delete*`). Easy to get backwards
  since the naming is confusingly close.
- `activityQueues`/`decisionQueues` are plain maps, not `store.Table`s, and
  are deliberately excluded from `backendSnapshot` (documented in both
  `store.go`'s `InMemoryBackend` doc comment and `persistence.go`'s
  `restoreDirtyTablesLocked` doc) -- this predates this audit pass and was
  not changed. Don't flag it as a fresh persistence regression; it's a
  pre-existing, intentional simplification (see gaps above for the
  follow-up).
- `CreationDate`/`StartTimestamp`/etc. use hand-rolled
  `float64(time.Now().UnixMilli()) / milliDivisor` instead of
  `pkgs/awstime.Epoch`. Output is equivalent (epoch-seconds float64, matches
  the real Timestamp shape), so this is a reuse/style nit, not a wire bug --
  left alone this pass to stay within scope, but worth a `pkgs` reuse cleanup
  later.
- `executions`/`history` are keyed by `domain+workflowId` only, NOT
  `domain+workflowId+runId` (see store.go's `InMemoryBackend` doc comment).
  This is why `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution` (this pass) can't retain the
  completed old run as an independently queryable record, and why
  `StartChildWorkflowExecution`'s child must have a workflowId that has no
  *currently open* run anywhere in the domain, even across unrelated
  lineages -- a real multi-run redesign is a bigger project than a parity
  bug-fix pass; don't attempt a partial fix without redesigning both tables
  together.
- `WorkflowExecution.OpenTimerIDs`/`ParentWorkflowID`/`ParentRunID`/
  `ParentInitiatedEventID`/`ParentStartedEventID` (new fields this pass) are
  internal-only: they're never marshaled onto any AWS wire response directly
  (`DescribeWorkflowExecution`/list handlers project them into
  `openCounts`/`executionInfo.parent` via separate DTOs in
  `handler_workflow_executions.go`), but they DO round-trip through
  Snapshot/Restore for free since `executions` is a "clean" `store.Table`
  (see store.go) -- don't add a wire-visible field with the same name by
  accident, and don't assume they need special `persistence.go` wiring if you
  add more.
